# Calculator

### Abilities
- Able to read and understand Java syntax.
- Able to work with arithmetic operations in Java.

### Short description
Write a simple calculator - a console application that will implement  some operation.

Please see readme.md  file in skeleton repository for detailed instructions.


### Detailed instructions
In this task, you need to write a console application that will implement 4 operations:
- addition 
- subtraction
- multiplication 
- division 

You have to modify class `Calculator.java` and implement interface `ICalculator`. Also class `Calculator.java` has to 
set precision for operations in the constructor of the class.

All operations of the calculator must display the result with the specified accuracy precision.

`Ex.: if precision is 2, then 10.1 + 6.354 = 16.45`

Impossible operations (division by zero of a positive number, division by zero of a negative number, etc.) 
must also be processed correctly (the way Java handles them).
